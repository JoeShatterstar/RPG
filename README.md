=================================================================================

In this repository, you'll find all the scripts from the tutorial above but from where Peter left them. I'm not sure if Peter will ever continue that series or not but if he do, then this will be started at the end of episode 278.
For this series, I completely through away the camera system from those tutorials and replace them from the 3rd person / first person camera system I'll write myself. Part of this camera system is previously developed by 3dbuzz.com, it's a free and greate video tutorial series and you can find them in the website under Unity section. Follow them because I won't explain anything related to that camera system!
For the character movement system, I'll through away the system Peter has, for two reasons :
1- There is Mecanim in unity now and we should use it
2- The system that Peter made is not as flexible and as complete as I would like it.
So I decided that if I'm going to make a new system, I would make a new video tutorial series on it too. You can find it here :

Follow that tutorial because for this one I just simply import that character movement system and use it without explaining things about it.

The repository won't contain those materials that are commercial, like icons, character models and animations. If you are in game development, then you can simply pay a little money to buy them and then use them, if you don't want to pay, then go on and make them and don't ask me to share those materials because I will respect developers !

Also, for property drawer collection that I would use in these series, take a look at this link :

I would go through few of them that I found useful in the video series.
